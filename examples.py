GNU_LICENSE_DOC = "The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. \
\
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. \
\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. \
\
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. \
\
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \
\
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. \
\
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. \
\
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. \
\
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free."

POKEMON_GO_TERMS_OF_SERVICE = " welcome to the pokémon go video game services which are accessible via the niantic inc niantic mobile device application. This section of the license describes who is eligible to use the services. Unless stated otherwise for a particular Service, children are not allowed to use the Services. A “Child“ is a person (a) under 13 years old (for residents outside of the EEA, except for the Republic of Korea); (b) under 16 years old or such age needed to consent to the processing of personal data in their country of residence (for residents of the EEA); or (c) under 14 years old (for residents of the Republic of Korea). Niantic Game and App Resources contains information on the age requirement for each of our Apps. \
\
For Services that permit Child participation, parents or legal guardians (“Parents“) must provide verified consent. Parents can provide and verify their consent through the Niantic Kids Parent Portal, or through another authorized third-party provider made available through the Service. Where Parental consent is required, Niantic recommends that Parents monitor the Child’s online activity and use of the Service. \
\
The verification and consent process for Children is performed by one of several third-party providers (“Verification Provider“). The Parent must register with the Verification Provider before a Child may use the Services. The Verification Provider will ask the Parent to verify their identity and to consent to the creation of an Account for the Child. Upon receipt of Parent verification and consent, the Verification Provider will enable the Parent to create an Account for the Child. Parental consent applies exclusively to the Service for which it has been granted. \
\
A Parent who wishes to rescind their previously-provided consent to a Child’s access to and use of the Services should follow the instructions for Account deletion, which can be found in the respective help centers here. \
\
Purchases made through the Services are limited to Account holders who either (a) are the age needed to consent to a contract in their country of residence; or (b) if younger, have the consent of a Parent to use the Service. Parents can consult their device settings for the App to restrict in-App purchases by a Child, and should also monitor activity in their Child’s Account, including the purchase of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods. \
\
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NIANTIC DECLINES ANY RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING ANY ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY A CHILD WITH OR WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A PARENT. IF YOU ARE A PARENT AND YOU GIVE YOUR PERMISSION FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER FOR ONE OF THE SERVICES, YOU THEREBY AGREE TO THE TERMS RELATING TO USE OF THE SERVICES BY YOUR CHILD."
